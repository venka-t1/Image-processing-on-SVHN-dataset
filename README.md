# Image-processing-on-SVHN-dataset
Feedforward/MLP and convolutional neural network classifier models for the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
the process includes building, training, validating, evaluating and saving the model for the task of classifying real-world images of digits into one of ten classes
This model for the SVHN dataset is designed to efficiently learn from the complex, real-world images of house numbers by leveraging multiple layers of convolutional filters, pooling operations, normalization, and dropout.
